# DevOps Lesson 3 - CYF London 8

This is the base repo to clone for the DevOps lesson 3. It has a basic Express.js application serving a small Hello World server.

## Installation and Requirements

* To run this application, you need any supported Node version (v14+ preferred)
* Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies

## Using and developing the Application

* The server can be started by running `npm start`
* Note that there is no hot-reload: if you make a change to the code, you will need to stop and start the server manually for the changes to take effect.
